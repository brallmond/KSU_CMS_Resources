# KSU_CMS_Resources
A repo of papers, guides, and figures to organize and help new HEP CMS students at KSU. 

There are four directories: papers, figures, notes, and unsorted.
Papers has full papers which were useful or are still useful for some reason.
Figures has often referenced or otherwise handy images or diagrams.
Notes contains subdirectories for each student where they can include whatever they like and go into some detail about
their projects.
Unsorted is a gathering place for resources someone may like to keep but doesn't yet know how to categorize.

The Papers and Figures directories each have one text document with a short description of each item and web link to the
original item (ideally). 

Of course, no repo or online resource can replace asking an expert or colleague. 

At some point in the future, when an item becomes depreciated, remember to add a directory for Archived materials.
