HiggsToTauTau.pdf is a recent paper detailing a Higgs to Tau Tau analysis. This is the main analysis we're involved in
at KSU, so this is a great paper to be familiar with.

HiggsToInvisible.pdf is a recent paper detailing a Higgs decay into neutrinos (i.e. invisible particles). This is of
general interest since neutrinos aren't detected directly at CMS.

EmbeddedLeptons.pdf is the paper describing the process of replacing muons in Z->mu mu decays with taus (i.e.
embedding the taus). The paper has a thorough analysis of the technique and is often cited in analyses using this
embedding technique. 

CERNBrochure2017.pdf is material you would receive on a tour of the LHC. It's packed with general information, and even
if you know it all already, you can probably learn how to communicate it a bit more clearly by reading this
(https://home.cern/resources/brochure/cern/lhc-guide).

HiggsBoson.pdf is the ATLAS paper where they announce the discovery of the Higgs Boson. Read it if you're sentimental!

Luminosity.pdf a primer on Luminosity. Probably more information in here than you need, but the first 5 or 6 pages are
good background knowledge.

MCNumbering.pdf describes what particles get what particle IDs in MonteCarlo samples (you'd be surprised how difficult
this is to find via google).

AnomalousCoupling.pdf describes what anomalous coupling is. The first 3 sections are very descriptive, although the amplitude 
is daunting without having taken QFT.

ImportantHiggsPaperCMS.pdf was published in Nature in 2022 on the 10 year anniversary of the Higgs discovery. It's a great 
overview of the current field and what we will be interested to study in Run 3.
