Herein are a list of links to interesting papers that should be publicly accessible!

Cern Brochure - https://cds.cern.ch/record/2255762/files/CERN-Brochure-2017-002-Eng.pdf
This is a great introduction to particle physics and all things LHC!

MC Numbering Scheme (PDG IDs) - https://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/reviews/montecarlorpp.pdf
This document lists the IDs of particles used in MC generators! It's invaluable if you
ever generate your own sample or need to look at LHE files.

A World Without the Higgs - https://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.3958.pdf
Other than being an interesting read in it's own right, this paper provides an excellent
bite-sized description of the Higgs and how EW symmetry breaking works.

Cross Section and Luminosity - https://cds.cern.ch/record/2800578/files/Cross%20Section%20and%20Luminosity%20Physics%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf
Accurate and short. These are necessary topics to understand in particle physics, and it's great that they're written so
shortly here :)

Possibly not publicly available, but great resources if you have a CERN account!

Concept of Luminosity - https://cds.cern.ch/record/941318/files/p361.pdf
The first 5 or 6 pages are great background info (the rest is over my head and not that relevant anyways)

Trigger Overview CMS DAS Jan 2022 - https://indico.cern.ch/event/1088671/contributions/4576980/attachments/2330164/4045629/Trigger_ShortExercise_FNAL_2022.pdf
The first 5 or 6 slides provide a great overview of important aspects of triggering at CMS

Analyses

A cool paper to read is the discovery papers for the Higgs from either CMS or ATLAS!
I leave you to google them :) They should be in PRL B or somewhere else readily available.
It's important to know your history!

Nature Paper : Higgs CMS - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04892-x
The pdf should be freely available at this link. It's worth reading this paper because it's written to be
extremely accessible, plus if you have relatives who are interested in your work, Nature is probably
the best known STEM journal. The paper also provides a great overview of Run3 interests.

Higgs to Tau Tau - https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12957
A very recent Higgs to Tau Tau paper! A must read if you're in the KSU group. If not,
it's interesting in its own right because the HtoTauTau channel uses different methods than
the Higgs to GammaGamma or Higgs to ZGamma channels. 

Constraints on Anomalous Higgs Boson Couplings to Fermions and Bosons via Tau Tau Decays - https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05120
A recent KSU grad wrote his thesis on this topic. The first 5 or 6 pages are very descriptive and
give you a flavor of BSM physics involving the Higgs. It's good to read just so you know what
"anomalous coupling" even means.

Embedding Technique for Tau Tau Backgrounds - https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01216
This technique is used by every Higgs to Tau Tau analysis, so it's good to be familiar with it.
The paper focuses on Z to Tau Tau decays, which is a nice change of pace, and helps the reader understand
how "background" data can be useful.
