Every user on lxplus has EOS space (use ls to show what you currently have there)
ls /eos/user/[first initial]/[username] #example below
ls /eos/user/b/ballmond
Additionally, use
fs lq -human

The default space on lxplus is /afs/ (i.e. the space you log into, just pwd and you'll see something like the following)
/afs/cern.ch/user/b/ballmond/

On cmslpc, there's also EOS space, but you have to use commands prepended with 'eos' to access it
For example
eosls /store/user/[username]
lists all the directories you have on cmslpc EOS space

Those are the spaces, here's how to check how much space you have AND the defaults you start with in each area.
Use this command to list the sizes of files in a normal directory
ll -h
"ll" is "long-list" and "h" is "human readable filesize"
Use this command to list the sizes of directories recursively, started from the directory you call the command.
du -h
or just list the last line, which is the size of the current directory including all subdirectories
du -h | tail -n 1
actually, that's equivalent to 
du --summarize -h
help pages are wonderful things
if you want just the sizes of the directories you're calling the command from, do
[ballmond@lxplus7116 public]$ du -h -d1
350M	./CMSSW_12_4_3
7.1G	./CMSSW_12_4_0
1002M	./WorkingDQMCMSSW_12_4_0
8.5G	.

on eos@cmslpc, use the command
eosquota

Finally, in your eos space on lxplus, you can view files online and allow others to access/view via the online interface
