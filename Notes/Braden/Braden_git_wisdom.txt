Braden's limited git wisdom

There are only 5 commands I need regularly

git clone <link>
put this at the top of your READMEs in repos, you will thank yourself

git add <file> <file> <file>
this adds files to be staged. You can add files to a .gitignore so that
git ignores them and doesn't prompt you to add them

git commit -m "your message here"
this lets you write a short message of the change you want to make

git push
this lets you push your commits

git pull
this lets you pull changes from a repo

About commits/changes, try to only make one functional change at a time and commit that.
This makes you commit often, and it makes you think about your code in manageable steps.
This also lets you peel back changes and keeps code unentangled.
Always make whitespace changes or file migrations a seperate commit from actual 
code functionality changes. 

Here's something I had to do once that took me forever to figure out

Pull someone else's copy of a repo with changes that aren't included in the repo
git remote add fork-with-changes https://github.com/link/to/user/branch
git fetch fork-with-changes
git pull fork-with-changes branch-with-changes
there will likely be some errors due to fast-forwarding/out-of-syncness, just pick whatever suggested option merges the branches instead of rebasing (or rebase it, idk what the difference is)

To get gitlab at lxplus, i had to do this ssh thing that is mentioned nowhere in their docs
ssh git@gitlab.cern.ch -T -p 7999


If you want to grab a specific branch of a large repo then
# grab the branches
git fetch origin 
# visualize the branches
git branch -r 
# checkout the branch you want
git checkout branch-i-want
