using terminal, make a list of runs belonging to a dataset and place them in a file

dasgoclient --query 'run dataset=/SingleMuon/Run2022C-v1/RAW' > RunsInSingleMuon2022CRaw.list

for each line of that file (a run number), run another dasgoclient query
it asks for the files in the dataset belonging to that run on a site that's available for user reading
these files are written to an output file

for line in `cat RunsInSingleMuon2022CRaw.list`; do dasgoclient --query "file dataset=/SingleMuon/Run2022C-v1/RAW run in [$line] site=T0_CH_CERN_Disk" > Run${line}.txt; echo "run $line done"; done

count the number of lines in each output file
0 means there are no files from that run available at that site
wc -l Run??????.txt
