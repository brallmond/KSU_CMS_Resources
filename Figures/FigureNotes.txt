ProductionDiagrams.png shows the 4 diagrams of Higgs production sutdied at the LHC
(http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/physics/the-higgs-boson.html)

higgsBranching.png shows the branching ratio of the Higgs for different production modes as a function of the Higgs
mass. Remember, Higgs = 125 GeV in the SM, so you only need to look at the values intercepting that (imaginary) vertical
line.

higgsDecay.png shows the actual values for a 125 GeV SM Higgs (i.e. the values you would pick out by eye looking at
higgsBranching.png where Higgs mass = 125 GeV). It is very useful to know these values offhand, especially that the Higgs
decays to two taus 6% of the time.

L1_HLT_timing_data_reduction.png illustrates the tiered data-collection system of CMS. Proton bunches collide every 25
ns. Taking 1/25ns, you find 40MHz, or 40,000,000 Hz of input. The L1 trigger system reduces this to 100kHz and the HLT
system reduces this to 1kHz, which is then saved to tape.  

CMSslice.png shows the different parts of the Compact Muon Solenoid in a cross-section. You'll see this often in
public presentations. 

Hadronization.png shows two gluons and two b-quarks "hadronizing" or turning into hadrons, which is a colorless
collection of quarks (which further decays). This image helps explain the phrase "quarks hadronize and produce jets."

JetOfHadronsVsHadronicTauCone.jpeg shows two cones, one made with hadrons in a broad cone and termed a "jet" another
made with specific hadrons in a narrow cone termed a "hadronic tau," as in a tau which decayed via a hadronic channel.
Confusingly, hadronic taus are also sometimes called "jet taus."
This image also helps explain the phrase "quarks hadronize and produce jets."

Rapidity.png shows a diagram of how rapidity (eta) is defined graphically. 

STXSGraph.png shows the Simplified Template Cross-Section control flow of an event via its kinematic information

TableOfHiggsResultsJune2022.png shows if ATLAS or CMS has published in a production/decay mode combination
